## Adding a few more concept references:

+ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSz5BjExs9o - Einstein Romanticized
+ Myoclonus (involuntary twiches during sleep) - something that seems random and arbitrary, but may be a direct response to a dream.
+ phosphenes (tiny lights when you close your eyes) - another thing that seems arbirary but turns out to be your mind.

## Technology Planning

I'm considering using my Google Glass Explorer kit because it is richly packed with sensors and provides intuitive UX.

## Concrete Software Proposal

It's all coming down to this: I'd like to create a frictionless space where 3D objects may bounce around, colliding and spinning. There will be some UI allowing people to edit the objects in the space. In addition, the viewer-user can switch between modes of view - from regular 3D object editing mode to 2D slice view (seeing only a limited dimension of it) or some other type of visual treatment - like a perspectival projection taken too far. The viewer-user should be able to intuitively relate the modes, realizing the shapes are manifested in all cases.

Given the right collection of shapes, and given the right lesser-dimension-view, we should find a visual or even synaesthetic sweet spot.
