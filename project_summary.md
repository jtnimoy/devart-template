## Description

While looking into my dog's eyes with LEDs in my hat, I had a revelation that startled me with great unsettle. I trust that our universe is more than the mere 3D or 4D in which I may perceive it. I also find it easy to believe there is intelligence within, without and all around us that we do not (cannot?) acknowledge - sort of in that SETI sense, but more importantly in a way that is right here with us at all those existing dimensions. There exist plenty of powers higher than myself - both perceivable and not. I am convinced that a beautiful system containing my own very limited one is far beyond me and my understanding of it, my surroundings, and myself. All I see are mere puppetry and shadows in comparison to their whole. I'd like to re-create this feeling of surrender. I wonder how I could present an interactive simulation evoking the above feeling of greater dimensions interacting with our percievable dimensions. I have not yet chosen technologies. Perhaps an interactive simulation is not the appropriate thing and it should be generative stills, or a visualized neural network. However, I'm strongly considering Compute Engine and I aim for a visual output. For concept research, I'm looking at:

+ [hypercubes](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypercube.html) - 3d shadow of a 4D thing.
+ [Angler Fish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish) - the unexpected connection between 2 magnifications.
+ Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions - social satire book about ridigly divided classes
+ other 4th dimensions in literature and film
+ Theory of relativity
+ [evolutionary computation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_computation)
